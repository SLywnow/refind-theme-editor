This is a modified version of Mark GÃ¶bel's (Bunny83) "UnityWindowsFileDrag-Drop" Project on Github.
You can find the original here: https://github.com/Bunny83/UnityWindowsFileDrag-Drop

See the Third-Party Notices.txt for mor info.

I have added Unity Oriented specific convenience methods and events that you can subscribe to.

WARNING:
This plugin only works on Windows and only in Builds.
Do not try to use in the Editor or on other Platforms,
you will not have much luck, but feel free to get the 
original from GitHub and modify it.

To try it out, create a build of the Sample Scene, and launch that.
Check out the Quickstart Guide included to see a better example of 
how to use File Hopper.
